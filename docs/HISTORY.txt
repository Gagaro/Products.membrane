---------------------------

- Initial egg release.

- removed deprecation messages in Plone 3.0 (Zope 2.10): Import of
  zope.app.annotation turned into zope.annotation 
  [jensens]


1.0b1
-----

- Introduced IUserChanger interface to separate the password
  changing from the user addition and deletion portions of
  IUserManagement. [rafrombrc]

- Completed general implementation of roles, groups, properties
  plugins. [rafrombrc, jhammel, rmarianski]


0.3
---

- Added a IUserManagement interface (from PlonePAS) to the
  usermanager.  It will be available to implementations that
  provide the corresponding IMembraneUserManagement interface
  directly or through adaptation.  This allows thing like
  PasswordResetTool to work.

- Renamed package to 'membrane' from 'Membrane' to reflect current
  standard python naming conventions. [rafrombrc]

- Major refactoring to use Zope 3 component engine to glue
  together all the pieces.  Mix-ins have been converted to
  adapters, providers are defined by implementation of specific
  interfaces. [rafrombrc]


0.2-alpha
---------

- Made Title in membrane_tool a ZCTextIndex too, so that
  enumerateGroups() of membrane_groups works without exact_match.

- getUserName and getUserId indexes in membrane_tool are now of
  type ZCTextIndex, allowing us to do exact_match=False queries in
  MembraneUserManager.enumerateUsers.

  PluggableAuthService.enumerateUsers recommends treating id and
  login as "contains" search tokens, but with our text index we
  can only do "starts with" searches.  However, that's much better
  than returning () for every call that has "exact_match=False".
