Changelog for Membrane

Membrane 0.3 (unreleased)

    - Added a IUserManagement interface (from PlonePAS) to the usermanager.
      It will be available to implementations that provide the corresponding 
      IMembraneUserManagement interface directly or through adaptation.  This
      allows thing like PasswordResetTool to work.

    - Major refactoring to use Zope 3 component engine to glue together
      all the pieces.  Mix-ins have been converted to adapters, providers
      are defined by implementation of specific interfaces. [rafrombrc]

Membrane 0.1 (unreleased)

    - Made Title in membrane_tool a ZCTextIndex too, so that
      enumerateGroups() of membrane_groups works without exact_match.

    - getUserName and getUserId indexes in membrane_tool are now of
      type ZCTextIndex, allowing us to do exact_match=False queries in
      MembraneUserManager.enumerateUsers.

      PluggableAuthService.enumerateUsers recommends treating id and
      login as "contains" search tokens, but with our text index we
      can only do "starts with" searches.  However, that's much better
      than returning () for every call that has "exact_match=False".
